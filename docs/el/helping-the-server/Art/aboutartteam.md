# 🎨 About the Art Team

Artists work mainly on the resourcepack, in many different ways. We use Discord to collaborate on the resourcepack, so anyone can help out without requesting anything from us.

There are also pages in Notion to keep track of weapons or creatures in [here](https://www.notion.so/gensokyorealoaded/afc6a9450ab048debb45474e0819e138?v=19d48d004b8e49f19553356274f49e91)(items) and [here](https://www.notion.so/gensokyorealoaded/0f4aa9d48f3e45e5b61e2b49f9f504e2?v=64296c0854104e15b819c6a51687a8ba)(mobs)

## Roles

**Note:** You don't need to open an application for this role, just go in the #resourcepack-general channel on Discord and ask for help.
